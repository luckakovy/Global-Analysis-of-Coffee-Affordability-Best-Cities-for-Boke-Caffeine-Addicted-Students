# Global Analysis of Coffee Affordability

## Project overview

This project analyses coffee affordability across cities worldwide with a student-centred focus.  
We ask three related questions: 
(1) How much of a typical resident’s daily income does one cup of coffee consume? (income-based affordability), 
(2) Is coffee cheap or expensive relative to the local price environment (price-context), and 
(3) For a fixed student coffee budget, how many days will one cup per day last (Coffee Survival Index)?

To answer these questions we combine cleaned city-level price data (coffee, restaurant and market items) with average monthly net salaries. The analysis constructs a simple city–price index, several affordability metrics, and a compact “student score” to rank cities for caffeine-addicted students. Data cleaning and initial extraction were performed by the team (see Data section). The notebook `analysis.ipynb` reproduces all steps and exports the main tables and figures in `final_coffee_affordability_results.csv` and the `figures/` folder.
